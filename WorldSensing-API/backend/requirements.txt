sqlalchemy == 1.4.23
psycopg2-binary == 2.9.1

To generate a requirements.txt file that includes the packages required by your application, you can use the pip freeze command. This command generates a list of all the packages installed in your current Python environment, along with their versions, which you can then save to a file.

To generate the requirements.txt file for your application, you can follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment for your project (optional, but recommended).
Install the required packages using pip install or by using a requirements.txt file that already includes the required packages.
Run the pip freeze command to generate the list of installed packages along with their versions.
Save the output of the pip freeze command to a file called requirements.txt in the root directory of your project.
For example, assuming you have already created a virtual environment and installed the required packages, you can generate a requirements.txt file by running the following command in your project directory:

Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt

In your specific case, the requirements.txt file might look something like this:

uvicorn == 0.15.0
fastapi == 0.70.0
mysql-connector-python == 8.0.27

Note that you do not need to include time or logging in the requirements.txt file, 
since these are built-in Python modules and do not need to be installed separately.
